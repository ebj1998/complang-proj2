In this blog, I will tell the story of the daunting journey of a C programmer getting thrown into Scala with no experience functional programming. This C programmer is an embodiment of us (Brady Murphy and Evan Jones) just to make the story easier to read. Though the journey was a difficult one, there were many lessons learned that made it all worth it. To teach about the lessons this C programmer learned, it would be beneficial to start from the beginning.

## Looking at the Program for the First Time

"Okay seriously, what even is this language on my screen?" was the first thought that went through this C programmer's mind. Looking at just the base code was enough to make anyone unfamiliar with functional programming close their IDE and start working on their System's project instead. This was exactly what this C programmer did when he first opened the RestaurantRecommender.scala. This initial shock came from viewing the already implemented code and seeing underscores being used and lines of code strung together with periods with seemingly no rhyme or reason. This C programmer decided he needed to take a break from this daunting program.

## Looking at the Program for Similarities to C

As the C programmer needed to find a base of understanding before diving into the project head-first, he returned to the program to find some similarities. This is when he noticed the use of "case class" which looked a lot like structs in C. Then slowly he started to see even more points of similarities he could go off of. He saw that Scala had function definitions that were close enough to allow him to figure out what was going on. Despite finding these numerous similarities, the C programmer knew that his solution would lie in the differences.

## Looking at the Program for Differences to C

This was the area that the C programmer started to understand how the differences were the true importance of functional programming in Scala. At this point, he noticed that the periods were being used as a way to access data and a way to call functions on data, which he knew would be important for the implementation. With not much code to work off to find differences, he knew it was time to start writing code and Googling what Scala can do.

## Implementing the Program

Now that all the analysis of the base code was done, it was time to enter the point where the majority of lessons were learned. Through the implementation, the similarities and differences were expanded even further, but I will focus only on the most notable instances. During implementation, the C programmer started to realize just how powerful functional programming is. One very interesting area that was seen was how integral the underscore is to create the flexibility of Scala. He had started to see that he could case into almost any data structure with ease and could create lines of code that did more than 20 lines done in C. The fact he was able to create intersections between lists with one function call astounded him. Beyond this, he saw just how easy it was to change around logic during the implementation when new problems were faced because of the functional nature. This was amazing to see from a C programmer.

## Conclusion

Despite the work it took, this C programmer is starting to get an interest in this functional programming style. Maybe in the future, he'll implement an entire project, but for now, he is going to go back to work implementing malloc in C.
